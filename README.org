*Literate & annotated bibliography* â€” Nicolas P. Rougier

*NOTE* This literate and annotated bibliography is an adaptation of the idea 
[[http://cachestocaches.com/2020/3/org-mode-annotated-bibliography/][Managing my Annotated Bibliography with Emacs' Org Mode]] by [[http://gjstein.com/][Gregory J Stein]].

* Introduction

The core idea behind literate bibliography is to have a single structured file where each entry corresponds to a reference. Information concerning an entry is stored as properties and two subsections allow to enter abstract and notes. To ease the manipulation, org-bib-mode provides a sidebar menu that displays the list of bibliograpic entries and provide tools to ease navigation. Under the hood, the org-bib-mode is the union of two  modes:

- [[https://github.com/rougier/pdf-drop-mode][pdf-drop-mode]] that allow to drag and drop a file in order to add it to the bibliography using its doi that is searched automatically.
- [[https://github.com/rougier/org-imenu/][org-imenu]] that allow to easily nagivate among entries and allowing various operations such as filtering entries, moving entries, etc.

org-bib mode is meant to be simple and robust (it is simple but not yet robust). If you need somethign more elaborated, have a look at the
amazing [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] mode by John Kitchin.

* Installation

org-bib mode depends on [[https://github.com/rougier/pdf-drop-mode][pdf-drop-mode]] and [[https://github.com/rougier/org-imenu/][org-imenu]] that needs to be installed. For example using [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]]:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(straight-use-package
 '(org-imenu :type git :host github :repo "rougier/org-imenu"))

(straight-use-package
 '(pdf-drop-mode :type git :host github :repo "rougier/pdf-drop-mode"))

#+end_src

* Configuration

The minimal document structure is a document with a single level headline that is used to store new entries. It is configurable via the [[help:org-bib-unsorted-header][org-bib-unsorted-header]] variable (default is "Unsorted").

#+begin_example
  #+LIBRARY-PATH: ~/Documents
  #+LIBRARY-FILE: ~/Documents/my-bibliography.bib
  
  * Unsorted
#+end_example

You need to ensure [[help:pdf-drop-exitftool-path][pdf-drop-exiftool-path]] and [[help:org-drop-pdttotext-path][pdf-drop-pdftotext-path]] points
to relevant binaries (these are needed to extract information from PDF
metadata (exiftool) or PDF content (pdftotext)). Last step is to tell org-bib
where to store PDFs. This is done via the "#+LIBRARY-PATH" keyword that you
can set at the top of your org-file.

* Key bindings

- "i" : show information
- "a" : show abstract
- "n" : show notes
- "u" : show URL (using xwidgets)
- "p" : show PDF (if available)
- "=" : show preview
- "b" : show bibtex

- "f" : filter visible entries
- "e" : export bibliography
- "m" : Move entry (refile)
- "M-<down>" : Move entry down
- "M-<up>" : Move entry up
- "S-<left>" : Next pdf page (when view is PDF)
- "S-<right>" : Previous pdf page  (when view is PDF)
  
- "<return>" : go to entry

- "<tab>" : toggle current section folding status
- "<S-tab>" : toggle all sections folding status

- "v i" : set view mode to info
- "v a" : set view mode to abstract
- "v n" : set view mode to notes
- "v p" : set view mode to PDF
- "v u" : set view mode to URL
- "v =" : set view mode to previex
- "v b" : set view mode to bibtex
- "v <return>" : exit view mode
  
- "?" : Mark entry as unread and move to next
- "!" : Mark entry as read  and move to next

* *Adding an entry*

The simplest way to add a new entry is to drag and drop a PDF file onto the org buffer. The PDF will be parsed to try to identify a DOI and the corresponding bibtex item will be collected from the crossref.org server. The new entry will then be created below the *Unsorted* header (whose name is configurable) and the file will be renamed and copied to the library folder.

If this procedure fails for some reason, you can also enter a new entry manually or using the [[help:org-bib-new-from-pdf][org-bib-from-pdf, ]][[help:org-bib-new-from-doi][org-bib-from-doi]] or [[help:org-bib-new-from-bibtex][org-bib-from-bibtex]] helper functions. In the latter case, no file will be automatically associated but you can later add a file into the library folder and rename it to "year - title.pdf" (replacing year and title with the actual year and title from the entry).

* Edit an entry

An entry is made of a properties block with two sub headlines (Abstract and Notes). You can edit any properties and add or remove them. But be careful to not remove bibliographic properties or else, the conversion to bibtex may fail because of some missing fields that are required.

* *Export the bibliography*

To export the library to a bib file, you can use the [[help:org-bib-export][org-bib-export]] command (that is bound to the "e" key on the sidebar).

* Filter view

You can filter the sidebar view ("f" key). Here are some example searches.
Note the absence of spaces.
